## Course Description
Evolutionary biology is unique in the biological sciences because it is, to a large extent, a historical discipline. The history of life on earth unfolds over thousands to millions of years – a timescale not particularly amenable to experimental manipulation or direct study. In the absence of paleontological data, which are sparse for many taxa, one of the best resources we have for studying evolutionary history over very long timescales is phylogenetic biology.  

In the first part of this course, students will survey the theory and application of modern phylogeny inferences. Modern phylogenetic biology, however, consists of much more than the mere estimation of evolutionary trees. Phylogenies are now used to investigate an enormous range of evolutionary questions. For instance, biologists have used phylogenies to ask questions about the tempo of species diversification or extinction; about the evolutionary processes that govern phenotypic changes in organisms through time; and about the characteristics of the long extinct ancestors of living species.  

In the second part of this course, students will learn the important theory and practical methods of phylogenetic comparative biology – the use of inferred trees in evolutionary inferences.
