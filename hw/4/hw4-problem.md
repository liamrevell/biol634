## Homework problem 4: Custom M*k* discrete trait evolution models

In this challenge you'll use the following two data files:

1. [brandley_table.csv](../../data/brandley_table.csv)
2. [squamate.tre](../../data/squamate.tre)

Following what we did in class, you should also...

1. Fit a loss/gain two rate model (one rate of loss, one of gain).
2. Fit loss/gain multi-rate model (5 rates of loss, 5 rates of gain).
3. Fit a loss/gain + "jump" model (5 rates of loss, 5 rates of gain, 1 jump loss rate).
4. Optionally, add in the ARD & SYM models
5. Make a comparison among all fitted models (including those optimized in class). Which model(s) is(are) the best?

Please note: if you elect to turn in your solution (this is not required) please do so in Rmarkdown and rendered (HTML or PDF) format.
