## Homework problem 1: Estimating a tree from DNA sequences using MP

In this challenge you will estimate a tree from a small-scale DNA sequence dataset from Jackman et al. (1999).

Download the following data file from the class page: [../../data/Jackman-etal.nex](Jackman-etal.nex).

1. Read the data file into memory. Use the functions of phangorn to estimate an unrooted MP tree using 'Fitch' (unweighted) parsimony. Plot the unrooted tree.
2. Root the tree using outgroup rooting and the outgroup taxa/taxon *Diplolaemus darwinii* and/or *Polychrus acutirostris*.
3. Compare your tree (by visual inspection) to the published tree (original reference below). Is it similar? How is it different?

Please note: if you elect to turn in your solution (this is not required) please do so in Rmarkdown and rendered (HTML or PDF) format.
